So i was bloating my modpack with new cool stuff as usual, and noticed i have several mods that add shuttles using odyssey with no coherence between them at all, and thought what would our beloved ferny do in this situation? Then i saw this mod "VVE - Shuttle Recipe Tweaks" that makes shuttles use parts from Vanilla Vehicles Expanded, and it clicked ! (Link to the mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3548950295 )

Ladies and Gentlemen, i present you (what took me half a day but would have been few minutes for modders) : 

Progression: Shuttles (Github link https://github.com/LibertySeeker/Progression-Shuttles )

This is still a WIP and not well tested but it's a simple xml mod and there is no red errors so it should work fine!

Here are the mods this mod mods (yes this sentence makes perfect sense), you still need "VVE - Shuttle Recipe Tweaks" because i am smart/lazy and didn't redo their work :
- Junk Shuttle
- Odyssey Transport Shuttle
- Ultratec Passeenger Shuttle
- Misstall's Shuttle
- Orca Shuttle
- Grav-Shuttle
- Stealth Shuttle

Here is a simple infographic how i categorized the shuttles

And here is a sheet for the exact modding done

PS: i dared uses the progression term cuz we all know ferny is cool, and i will take it down if needed. Of Course a better alternative would be for the op ferny or someone else to take it over as i don't think i can improve much on it for lack of technical skills. Although i still have some ideas..
